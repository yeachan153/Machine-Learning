# Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Welcome! This repository contains various notebooks with different mini machine learning/deep learning projects that I do. Here's a basic rundown of all the notebooks. The most recent ones are listed first.

1. **Scene classification through transfer learning (ResNet50 CNN)** <br>
This is an image classification project. I have around ~650 images I need to classify into 4 images. I use a convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet and apply transfer learning to achieve 94% classification accuracy. This was better than all the traditional computer vision approaches that were tried!

2. **Predicting Bike Rentals (Decision Trees, Random Forests & Linear Regression)** <br>
This is a classic regression problem, where the aim is to predict the number of bicycles that are rented in a time period. Methods implemented are random forests and linear regression.

3) **Using k-nearest neighbors to predict car prices** <br>
Here, the aim is to predict car prices based on feature similarity. Although it is a simple, KNN often gives surprisingly good results.
